# LimitlessLED DevAPI
http://limitlessled.com/dev is now down, but has been continuously linked and used as a resource for Milight/LimitlessLED application development. 

Finding an archive of the page is pretty difficult, and this repo aims to save people a lot of time and act as a permenant backup of the page by containing various archives.

This archive is from https://www.exalead.com/search/web/cached/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.limitlessled.com%2Fdev%2F

This archive contains all the important codes needed to develop applications for milight bridges. It should be the first one you read.

This archive is more recent but is partially incomplete. It includes the sections: "Wifi bridge v6 Apps that support RGBW and RGBW/WW/CW/CCT bulbs" and "LimitlessLED Wifi Bridge v6.0 Working Program code" 

Therefore it's encouraged to go here for recent V6 bulbs but the other archive for every little detail.

A really old archive from: http://archive.is/www.limitlessled.com 
# Future Work
I encourage first of all people to download these API's for themselves. 

Secondly, I would love to turn this repo into its own resource that properly organises the information.
